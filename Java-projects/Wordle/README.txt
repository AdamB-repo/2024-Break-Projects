This is a piece of software that aims to emulate wordle. It will read the words from the txt words.txt and choose a random word from it.
Then, the user will be able to guess words and be given feedback on which guessed letters are in the correct place
and which ones are in the word but not in the right place.

since words.txt is just a txt, people are able to modify it to add their own words and customize their wordle!
